There are plenty of improvements that could be made.

-The .prf preferences files are a black box right now, I have no idea what the
format is.

-Rewriting the bxproj interface so it can edit as well as create- adding new
files to the project file on CLI might be nice.

-Does debugging work on Linux? It should, but untested.

-Editor integration? A new "bxedit"?
